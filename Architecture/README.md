## Architecture

(1)  In this folder we will detail the AABE architecture employing 10 specific axioms of Human nature drawn from OZI-ology the science of Human Relatedness (Introspection) and Transformation. This is the framework for a fully functional Social-system organically forming a Human-Collective around a business purpose, commonly referred to as a Freelance-Franchise. 

(2)  Then we will give definition to the software creating the Entrepreneurial economic Decentralized ecosystem (EeDe) necessary to sustain AABE-lifeforms. The EeDe architecture will consist of the following modules:
  1. Allocations (specifically those of claims on future revenues)
  1. Governance (illustrating the operation of the bilateral Legatocracies of an AABE)
  1. Delegation (defining the mechanisms for distribution of Authroity across the Collective)
  1. Reputation (the organic creation and management of social currency)
  1. Capitalization (the systems necessary for budgetless cash-flow management)
  1. Inception (the spontaneous forming of Franchises from viable business notions)
  1. Assetation (how a non-legal entity can hold ownership of real-world assets)
  1. Taxation (the relationship of economic prosperity and local governments)

(3)  We will also address the architecture of all the tech layers from Blockchain to Retail Market including all the social interfaces that facilitate collaboration of franchise collectives. This architecture will address concerns such as what data must be recorded indelibly upon the Blockchain, eg: Contributions, Compensation and Claims upon future revenues.

(4)  There will be consideration given to the high-level architecture of a minimally functional Economic-Enclave which will include the following franchises:
* The EnclaveKeeper (the public utility responsible for the EeDe software maintenance and evolution)
* The CultureMaker (to support the culturing of new Franchises during the gestational period)
* The Interchange (for conversion of the Enclave currency to all outside currencies)
* The Registrar (to support Assetation)

(5)  As a product of these Architectures there will be a long list of systems that will need to be defined individually in Whitepapers explaining their rational and such things as the mathematics supporting algorithms and interfaces with other systems, etc. Each of these systems will then be described architecturally as needed to support the scoping of specific coding elements. Once we have fully deliberated the specification of a system a repository will be created for the coding thereof.
